[`rehype-pretty-code`](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code) is a Rehype plugin powered by the
[`shiki`](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) syntax highlighter that provides beautiful code blocks for Markdown or MDX. It works on both the server at build-time (avoiding runtime syntax highlighting) and on the client for dynamic highlighting.

## Line Numbers and Line Highlighting

PAN is a ten -digit unique alphanumeric number issued by the Income Tax Department of 
India. The structure of the first five characters of PAN, the first three characters represent the 
alphabetic series running from AAA to ZZZ and the fourth character of PAN represents the 
status of the PAN holder it will contain only “A”, “B”, “C”, “E”, “G”, “H”, “I”, “K”, “N” & 
“Q”. Fifth character of PAN represents the first character of the PAN holder's Father’s first 
name/surname in case of an individual. In case of non-individual PAN holder’s fifth 
character represents the last character of PAN holder's name. Get the input from the user, if 
all the cases are valid for PAN number’s first five values, then print “This might be valid 
PAN number” otherwise throw appropriate user defined exceptions (alphabetic series, fourth 
and fifth character input.)



```js
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.regex.*;

// Custom exception class for PAN validation errors
class Myexception extends Exception {
    public Myexception(String s) {
        super(s);
    }
}

public class pan_validation {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Myexception {
        // Prompt the user to enter the PAN number
        System.out.println("Enter the PAN number to validate:");
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String pan_number = sc.next().toUpperCase(); // Convert the input to uppercase for consistency

        // Prompt the user to specify if they registered for PAN as an individual
        System.out.println("Please enter yes if you registered for pan as individual:");
        String yes_or_no = sc.next();
        String first_name = "";

        // Determine the first name based on the user's registration type
        if (yes_or_no.equals("yes")) {
            System.out.println("Please enter your Surname:");
            first_name = sc.next().toUpperCase();
        } else {
            System.out.println("Please Enter your father's first name:");
            first_name = sc.next().toUpperCase();
        }
        sc.close();

        // Extract specific parts of the PAN number for validation
        String first_three_characters = pan_number.substring(0, 3);
        String six_to_eight_chars = pan_number.substring(6, 9);
        char fourth_character = pan_number.charAt(3);
        char last_character = pan_number.charAt(pan_number.length() - 1);

        // Validate the length of the PAN number
        if (pan_number.length() != 10) {
            throw new Myexception("PAN number should be exactly 10 characters. Please enter the PAN number again.");
        }
        // Validate the first three characters (alphabetic series from A to Z)
        else if (!Pattern.matches("[A-Z]{3}", first_three_characters)) {
            throw new Myexception("The first three characters should be an alphabetic series running from A to Z.");
        }
        // Validate the fourth character (status identifier)
        else if (!Pattern.matches("[ABCEGHIKNPQ]", Character.toString(fourth_character))) {
            throw new Myexception("The fourth character representing status should be in the set ABCEGHIKNQ.");
        }
        // Validate the fifth character (matching the first character of the provided name)
        else if (pan_number.charAt(4) != first_name.charAt(0)) {
            throw new Myexception("The fifth character should match the first character of your father's name or surname.");
        }
        // Validate the sixth to eighth characters (numeric series from 0 to 9)
        else if (!Pattern.matches("[0-9]{3}", six_to_eight_chars)) {
            throw new Myexception("The 6, 7, and 8 characters should be numbers from 0-9.");
        }
        // Validate the last character (alphabet between A to Z)
        else if (!Pattern.matches("[A-Z]{1}", Character.toString(last_character))) {
            throw new Myexception("Last character should be an alphabet between A-Z.");
        }
        // If all validations pass, print a success message
        else {
            System.out.println("This Might be a Valid PAN number.");
        }
    }
